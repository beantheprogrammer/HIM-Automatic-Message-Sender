Then, open the 'HIM Auto Message Sender' program, where you will be asked to upload this '.csv' file.
Upon uploading the file, a window with four sections will appear.

### Message ###
This segment is straightforward: enter the intended message you wish to send. The message box must not be blank and should not contain only spaces. As this is a professional organization, kindly include your name in your message and avoid sending anything inappropriate.

### Add Filter ###
You will need to provide two inputs: firstly, indicate the column in the Google Sheet containing the data you wish to select, and secondly, specify the targeted value from that particular column.

For instance, if you aim to send a message to every phone number associated with a team captain named Andrew Lau, refer to the example below. In this case, 'TEAM CAPTAIN' corresponds to the column 'AO' in Google Sheets. Therefore, you should choose 'AO' as your Google Sheets column. Next, input 'Andrew Lau' into the 'Targeted Value' box, as this is the team captain you intend to select.

Upon selecting 'Add Filter,' your designated message will be sent to each volunteer whose team captain is identified as Andrew Lau.

**(Note: If your targeted value is empty, leave the box blank.)**
